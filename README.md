KaavadBits: Exploring Branching Narratives for Tangible Interactive Storytelling through a Kaavad-inspired Diegetic Installation
ABSTRACT: This work explores the tangibility of branching storylines through Kaavad– an Indian storytelling tradition dating back approximately 400 years. KaavadBits is a tabletop storytelling installation embodying the narrator-patron perspective of Kaavad Baanchana (the act of reciting the Kaavad). For diegetic worldbuilding of selected tales from Panchatantra– a compilation of ancient Indian animal fables, the narrator takes the physical form of a tree, with which the audience (who are also patrons to the narrator) interact using diegetic tokens for a seamless multi-modal recitation of the storylines. Building on and adding to the related explorations, we propose, qualitatively assess, and discuss the insights for a fresh and incremental perspective on interactivity that immerses the audience throughout the story with choices, riddles and character associations. Through our work, we aim to strike consequential tangible explorations on various lesser-known Indian forms of storytelling that may develop new interaction techniques.
